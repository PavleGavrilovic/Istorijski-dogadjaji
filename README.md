# Istorijski-dogadjaji
Final Project for Front-End course at Comtrade Code Academy (2021)


24.07.2021.
Added all created files so far - all of the HTML pages, the CSS file, JS folder containing both the JavaScript file and the jQuery file, and the Assets folder. The Assets folder contains the fonts and images used, including the placeholder images that will be removed later on.

- The Website is fully designed for mobile phone screen width, tablet screen width and desktop screen width.
- The JSON file data.json is used as a simulation of a database. When the index page is loaded, 3 random articles from data.json are rendered. Also, a featured article that happened on the current day appears, if the "database" contains an event that happened on that day.
- The website now contains a page that shows all of its historical events, along with sorting and filtering options.
- The historical events can be selected and saved to the Library page, which has the options to remove or add new events, as well as sort and filter the events.
- Both the Events and Library page have pagination.
- Registering and logging in is possible.
