# Istorijski-dogadjaji
Final Project for Front-End course at Comtrade Code Academy (2021)


24.07.2021.
Added all created files so far - all of the HTML pages, the CSS file, JS folder containing both the JavaScript file and the jQuery file, and the Assets folder. The Assets folder contains the fonts and images used, including the placeholder images that will be removed later on.

- The Website is now fully designed for mobile phone screen width and desktop screen width.
- The JSON file data.json is used as a simulation of a database. When the index page is loaded, 3 random articles from data.json are rendered.
